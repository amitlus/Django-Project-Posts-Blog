# Django-Project-Posts-Blog
My first coding project- coded 2 years ago before starting Computer Science degree in the University.  
I learned everything by my own online.  
During this project I realized that I want to be a programmer, and then I signed-up to my CS degree.

UPDATE:  
On the first day of 2022 I checked if it runs, and had to change "load staticfiles" to "load static" in Templates/index.html following Django new version.

For me: (When I'll try to run it again in 2 years haha)

1. Download a clone of the project
2. Open in the IDE (PyCharm or else)
3. In the Terminal type:
4. python -m pip install -U pip // (Install pip)
5. pip install virtualenv // (Install virtual environment)
6. virtualenv nameOfEnvIWant // (Set Virtual environment)
7. cd nameOfEnvIWant
8. cd Scripts
9. activate
10. pip install django // (If not installed already)
11. cd ..
12. python manage.py runserver // (In the project directory where manage.py live
